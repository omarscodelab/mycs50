1.  A header file in the C standard library that provided a set of specific exaxt width integer types that allow programmers to write more portable code
2.  These codes are used to define and integer of a precise size. uint8_t is for unsigned integer 8 bit, uint32_t for unsigned integer 32 bit
int32_t for signed 32 bit integer and uint16_t for unsigned integer 16 bit.
3.  BYTE=8bits DWORD=32bits LONG=32bits WORD=16 bits
4.  in ASCII is BM or in hex is 0x424d
5.  BfSize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file. biSize is representing the number of bytes required by the structure.  
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
7.  biBitCount
8.  Missing permissioning, invalid file name, file does not exist, etc. 
9.  It indicates how many elements we want to read, which is generally 1
10. 3
11. As per man page "The  fseek()  function  sets the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by stream", which means that
it points to a specific location in afile. 
12. It moves file pointer position to given location. ref. http://fresh2refresh.com/c-programming/c-file-handling/fseek-seek_set-seek_cur-seek_end-functions-c/
